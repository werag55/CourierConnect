# CourierConnect

**Overview:**

CourierConnect is a collaborative project developed by a team of three for a university assignment. This Courier Hub system streamlines the process of requesting courier services from multiple companies. The project is divided into several components:

1. **CourierCompanyApi:** A Web API serving as the backbone for courier company interactions.
2. **CourierConnectWeb:** The main application, an ASP.NET MVC web app providing a user-friendly interface.
3. **CourierConnect.DataAccess:** A library handling communication between the web app and the database.
4. **CourierConnect.Utility:** A utility project for additional functionalities.
5. **CourierConnect.Models:** A library containing shared classes used across the application.

**Key Features:**

The application allows users to easily request courier services by submitting orders. These orders are then distributed to three courier companies, streamlining the process of collecting offers in one place and making it easier for users to choose the ideal courier. For logged-in users, there's the additional capability to review placed orders and track pending or completed deliveries.

Moreover, the platform provides functionalities tailored for courier company employees. Office workers can access and manage inquiries and submitted offers, enabling them to accept or reject orders. Couriers, on the other hand, can oversee and handle their assigned deliveries efficiently.
